    "### Task #1\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "CNN-RNN architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the CNN encoder: I use the default per-trained Resnet as my feature extractor. Even though Resnet is trained on the Imagenet dataset, it still performs pretty well on our COCO dataset. I also replace the fully connected layer in the origin Resnet with our embedded fully connected layer to make the output features extracted by Resnet (size 2048) to a suitable size that can be fed into our RNN decoder (embedded size 512).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the RNN decoder: I first use an embedded layer to embed the input captions. And then feed the features from the encoder and input captions into a single layer LSTM. After that, I use a single dense layer to transform the output of the LSTM to words probability. But after some testing, I found that a single dense layer may not be sufficient for our decoder to learn all the features from LSTM. Therefore, I added two more dense layers and some dropout layers to improve the learning ability of the network and prevent overfitting.This turned out to be pretty good. The model not only can learn more (lower overall training loss) but also converge faster. I also initialize the bias of the forget gate of the LSTM to 1 to increase the memory length of our LSTM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Value of variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "For batch size: I started with batch size of 64 which is suggested in this paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf). And I soon find out that the training loss fluctuates a lot near the end of the first epoch. So I added the batch size to 128 which worked quite well.\n",
    "\n",
    " For vocab threshold: If the threshold is 5, the final total vocab size is about 9000. If the threshold is 6, the final total vocab size is about 8000. After testing, setting the threshold to 6 won't hurt the overall accuracy of the network. And about 1000 less vocab size can reduce the total number of parameters in the final fully connected layer which will help boost the training speed (fully connected layers are more computational expensive since all the nodes are fully connected to each other).\n",
    "\n",
    "For hidden size and embedded size: I start with 512 for both of these two variables which are suggested in this paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf). And they both worked fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "For number of epoch:\n",
    "\n",
    "For save every and print every: I set print every to 200 since I can see the training loss for every batch. The printing is just to keep track of the progress of the model and I think print every 100 batch is too frequent. I want the model to save every epoch for 2 reasons. First, every epoch takes a lot of time to train and I want to save frequently to prevent any loss of connection or things like crashing. Second, I want to load each checkpoint file to see if the model has a tendency of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "I left the transforms as default. \n",
    "\n",
    "For resize and random crop: Since we used Resnet 50 as our feature extractor, the required input size is 224x224. Therefore, the final image has to be cropped to 224x224. Resize the image to 256 seems to be a good choice because it is close to the final image size (the random cropped final image will not contain too much unrelated information or leave any important information outside the final image) but not too close (reduce randomness which can hurt generalization).\n",
    "\n",
    "For random horizontal filp: increase the variety of training samples which can help the model generalize better. I don't think vertical flip is necessary. Because after vertical flip a picture, the picture may not make sense. e.g vertical flip a person.\n",
    "\n",
    "For normalization: Since all pre-trained model (VGG, Resnet, Inception) are initially trained on imagenet, as pytorch official GitHub (https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/master/imagenet/main.py#L92-L93) suggests, all the images from imagenet are normalized to mean(0.485, 0.456, 0.406), std(0.229, 0.224, 0.225) before fed into these models. Therefore, by normalizing our input images with the same mean and std, we can achieve better performance since our samples are in a very close distribution with the pre-trained network. (I didn't retrain the feature extractor nor the batchnorm layer in the feature extractor)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "For the encoder: We use the encoder as a pre-trained feature extractor. Therefore, we don't want to retrain parts of the network which are used to extract features (e.g convolution layers). Also, in the pre-processing step, we have already normalized our train data to a distribution that is close to the original data used to train this model. Therefore, it is unnecessary to re-train the batch normalization layers. We have removed the classifier in Resnet and replaced it with a new fc layer(embed). Since this is a newly added layer, we need to train it from scratch. Therefore, all parameters from this layer should be trainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the decoder: We need to train the entire decoder from scratch. Therefore, all the parameters from the decoder should be trainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "For optimizer: After some research, I have tried two optimizers: SGD and Adam.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGD: SGD is very simple but is still used in the training process of a lot of famous models. So, I decided to give it a try. Since it only has a fixed learning rate, I can only choose a very small learning rate. This lead to a very slow training process. Also, the momentum parameter is very hard to tune. I tried a lot of different values, but the training loss still fluctuates a lot (Since the batch size of 128 is already pretty big, I think this is due to the difficulty of getting over local minimum). \n",
    "\n",
    "Adam: I finally switch to Adam. Adam will auto-decay the learning rate as the training going. Therefore, I can choose a much larger learning rate at the beginning which speeds up the training process a lot.  Also, I read some paper talking about how Adam optimizer will hurt generalization. But in this project, the model trained by Adam optimizer performs pretty well on testing data in notebook 3. (Also, this paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) also suggest that Adam works the best)\n"

If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",

In the next (optional) step of this notebook, we provide some guidance for assessing the performance on the validation dataset."

    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
